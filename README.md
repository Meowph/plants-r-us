# Plants-R-Us

An immersive app that allows you to keep track of many plants while hiking through the wilderness of WV. Here, you can check to see if a plant is edible or not, and if it is located near you. 

## You Will Be Able To:

1. Create a username for your profile
2. Select any plant to add to your profile
3. Create tailored notes for any differences you might spot between the
plant and the listed description
4. Add your thoughts to the chat log

**NOTE:** All of the wild flora in WV is listed in this app. Please, double-check each plant you come across before consumption. **DO NOT** assume the plant is safe just because it doesn't look harmful!
